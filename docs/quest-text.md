## Quest Descriptions

## Clockwork

### First Clockwork

*click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click*

You can't seem to understand what you've found.

You should find someone who knows about this sort of thing...

---

### Upgrade Clockwork

"Huh, I've only heard of these things..."

"I'm reasonably sure I can get it working again, just give me a minute..."

---

## Crafting

### Welcome

"Looks like you've got quite the junk pile there, eh?"

You notice a man watching you, he has various trinkets and glass vials hanging off him in all directions.

He takes a few steps closer, the accessories jingle against each other as he moves.

"Take this, you can use it to smash the ones you don't want!"

He hands you a shiny hammer.

"You can use the smashed dust to change other items. I think you'll find it's quite useful."

"Save up enough of the dust and maybe I'll come by again..."

"Always keep collecting."

---

### Enough Dust

"You need help, eh?"

You notice the man who gave you your crafting hammer so long ago.

"Oh... oh wow...."

The trinkets jingle as he gestures towards the hundreds upon hundreds of enchanted items you possess.

"... you really need help. That's quite the junk heap you got there."

"Take this and keep collecting, I just might reopen my shop at this rate."

"Always keep collecting."

---

## Droop

### Poorly Drawn Map

You find a crudely drawn map on the Hobgoblin's body,

It's hard to make out what's what in the map, but it's clearly signed by a "Commander Droop".

Isn't that the goblin that robbed you back at the pub?

It's barely legible, but think Droop is probably {{direction}} from here, but it's unclear how far.

You should head in that direction and kill more Hobgoblins to find an updated map.

---

### Found Droop

"He's right over there!!"

The Hobgoblin points over to some rocks and collapses.

"HEY! you kill droop's friend, you say sorry to droop!"

The tiny goblin bursts out from behind the rocks, still wearing his expensive noble clothing riddled with disgusting stains

After briefly chasing the shrieking goblin, he gives up and begins pleading for his life,

just as you're considering your options, Brewconia shows up again.

"I don't care what he did, what's it going to cost for you to free him?"

she looks disappointed,

"Ugh, I don't have time for this, here just take this and some gold..."

You release Droop and he sprints into Brewconia's arms, who then walks off while bottle feeding him like a baby.. using wine.

---

## Meet the queen

### Intro

"Ahem,"

A well dressed individual stands before you, he retrieves a concealed envelope from his person.

"Her majesty has taken notice to your accomplishments and has requested your presence"

You reluctantly accept the sealed parchment, its wax embossment shines with wealth.

"The queen is hardly known for her patience, and be sure to bring an offering for her pet"

Before you have time to ask what this "pet" is, the dapper courier is gone.

The letter instructs you to enter the Rotherham Palace.

---

### Not Here

You present your invitation to the palace guards,

"My sincerest apologies, her majesty is not currently at the palace."

"Her business carries her all across these lands with her personal assistant, you must understand."

You leave dejected.

---

### Brewconia Is The Queen

You are led through the palace towards the great dining hall.

You hear a familiar voice, "Droop need more rags!"

No.

What is that horrible thing doing here?

How are you going to leave without killing it?

Another familiar voice chimes in, "Droop, I told you we're out, do you want a wine bottle?"

"DROOP WANT BLOOD!" The raspy goblin voice responds

You enter the dining area and see a lavish feast that's been ravaged.

Droop's noble clothing is covered in food scraps and loose torn fabric, he stands on the banquet table dancing in a carved turkey carcass

Brewconia can be seen sitting with her feet up at the other end of the table, she's in extremely fine royal clothing

"Oh, you, yes. I have a favor to ask you..."

---

### Brewconias Favor

"Droop here has a very specific diet of blood soaked rags and various smoked meats"

"The royal kitchen is able to keep a steady supply of smoked meats, but they refuse to help with the rags."

"Take these,"

Brewconia hands you a fist full of heavily stained, but clean, rags.

"Go soak up some tasty things for my Droop, bring them back here, and I'll be sure you're rewarded"

Her servants look annoyed.

---

### Finished Rags Bad

You delivery the bloody rags to Brewconia...

"Hmmmm, well I guess he wont starve, but I was really expecting some better quality samples from you."

"I'm going to drink some wine, I'll have one of my servants bring you one of my many treasures."

---

### Finished Rags Good

You delivery the bloody rags to Brewconia...

"Ah yes, these will do. I knew I could rely on you."

"Join me for a drink, one of my servants will fetch an artifact from my adventuering days."

---

### Finished Rags Perfect

You delivery the bloody rags to Brewconia...

"Oh, these are perfect, my Droop will absolutely love these!"

"Lets crack into the good stuff, I'd like to tell you the story of how I found this fine artifact..."

Brewconia drinks with you and tells a fantastical story.

---

### Finished Rags Legendary

You delivery the bloody rags to Brewconia...

"Wow. If you can get me more of these, we can be very good friends."

Brewconia pulls a flask from an inside pocket, takes a swig, and hands it over to you.

"Follow me, I'm going to hand pick your reward here."

Brewconia brings you to a great treasure room, you have never seen anything like it.

---

## Naga scale

### Bird Figurine

"I'll give you this golden figure for that lamp oil you've got there!"

the dock fisherman walks over after having spotted you,

"It's not worth much, but it's worth more than the oil is to you... I ran out, and it'll be a long night without it."

---

### Chimera Hook

"Ah! This is just what I've been looking for!"

The alchemist, Trimarim, loudly stomps over to you pointing at your mound of flesh

"I'll trade ya for this, it's certainly worth more to you..."

---

### Flaying Knife

"You could call me a collector of sorts."

"Take this knife, I think you'll find it is much more useful to you."

---

## Rebirth

### First Birth

Everything around you begins to fade away. A glowing creature appears before

"This world is in need of powerful heroes."

The creatue's voice resonates from within your own mind

"... but time has been cruel to you. You have reached the limits of this body."

When you are ready for your next life, use this.



Find the "Totem of Rebirth" in your inventory

---

### First Rebirth

You wake up.

Everything is familiar, but different.

Time feels slower, you age like the earth.

Things feel simpler now, more intuitive... automatic even

---

### Second Cap

The glowing being appears again, this time a bit more clearly.

"Ah, yes, you're much stronger this time... but it is not enough."

"You grow too slowly for this world, you are no match for even its natural inhabitants..."

"... let alone the unnatural ones."

The Totem in your hands begins to transform.

"You will wake with a greater understanding of this world."

---

### Third Cap

The glowing figure once against appears.

"Your power is incredible. I am of no further help, you have reached the limits of your being."

The figure glows, but it's not blinding like before -- You find yourself able to observe their movement

"There is one last thing I can offer, however..."

"Offer up your great power and live your life again, and you shall received ascended treasures."

---

### Forbidden Cap

The glowing creature from before appears in front of you.

"You let that horrid witch turn my totem in that awful orb?"

The creature points to your Orb of Forbidden Power.

"You are not meant for such a object, give it here"

The creature begins reaching for the orb. You see its arm reach out, as it reaches the orb you realize something

This is no god.

This is just another aberration.

It's different from the others but you recognize its stench.

You grab the glowing creature's arm, it reels back in disgust and offense.

The expression on the creature changes as it realizes what you know.

Before you can move, the glowing aberration flees up the mountain and disappears into the clouds above the Altar of Transcendence with a massive beam of light.

Your orb... it's cracked...

---

### Amixea Can Help

"My my, it seems you've made yourself some enemies," Amixea gestures towards your broken orb

"It's marked by the creature you faced. You must defeat it before I can help you."

"Go to the Altar of Transcendence, bring this with you."

"Know that where you are going, death is not like it is here."

---

### Amixea Did Help

"You continue to impress me, hero." Amixae stands as you approach, she looks at you with a newfound respect.

"The creature you've slain today has consumed a thousands lifetimes, it lives to trick foolish adventurers such as yourself into feeding it their very lives."

She pauses for a moment in reflection,

"You see, a dog knows not of his chain until he strays from the pole. I had assumed you were like the others, and for this I am sorry."

"I will help you, I believe you can bring about change."

"There are many more creatures like the one you fought living out their vile existence in The Void."

"I believe that you, alone, can stop them."

"Bring me back another of these void essences, we should be able to use it to restore my Witchforge to its former glory"

---

### Ascended Rebirth

You are reborn once again.

---

### Forbidden Rebirth

Your forbidden orb glows and consumes your life force.

The glowing creature is nowhere to be seen.

You are reborn once again.

## Washed up

### Wake Up

You wake up.

How long were you out?

Your clothes are still damp with sea water. The sound of the waves crashing almost jogs your memory for a moment, but it's all a blur.

There's a port nearby, maybe the fishermen there can help.

---

### Starting Dock

You find your way to Valtham Landing and ask about the water

"Unless ye got f'kin gills I can't see much how y'd survive those waters."

It's hard to understand the old fisherman through his thick drawl

"I can get ye aroun' tho, me brothers too. Pay yer fee and we'll get ya there safe."

---

### Docks

You walk up to the dock and begin asking the fisherman about the waters --,"Have you talked to my brother in Valtham Landing yet?",The fisherman seems to have no interest in your queries.,"Listen, take this to him for me, will you?", ,He hands you an Old Boot

"MY BOOT!",The old fisherman rapidly waddles towards you, his one boot stomps loudly with every other step.,"Thank you, my brothers and I have been searching for this for ages...",He struggles the boot onto his bare foot, looks at it for a moment,,"It's not the one.",He rips it off and throws it into the water.,"Thanks for trying though! While I have your attention, can you bring this to my other brother in Boatwright? He works at the docks there. Take this, too, I don't need it.", ,You receive an Old Pocket Watch

"mmm, yes, that is my pocket watch.",...,"you're still here? there's no jobs open right now.", ,"rlright, take this to my brother in Northern Point", ,He hands you an Old Fishing Rod, ,"reward? yeah I guess... take this too, clean it up a little and maybe it'll be useful."

"Oh, this thing.","Yup.","That's my fishing rod.","Well, I guess you got a good thing going for you here, take this to my brother in Sherlam Landing.", ,He takes the Old Fishing Rod and hands you an Old Fishing Book.

The fisherman stares you directly in the eyes.,He slowly takes the book from you, flips through it a few times, ,He hands you an Old Walking Stick and says "Rotherham"

The fisherman brother at Rotherham is rather busy, it takes some time to find him., ,"Ah, this old thing... My brother must have sent you; this was our father's.","Can you do one last favor? My brother out in Canogeo Harbor, he's a big drinker, bring him this Old Coin

The fisherman brother takes the coin from you., ,"I heard about all the traveling you've been doing.", ,"How about you come out drinking with me tonight? I know a great place nearby!", ,"Meet me at the The Hidden Stump Inn, you can find it 42, 32"

---

### Brewconia

"You look new here,"

A stunning half elf in fine gemstoned bardic wear looks you up and down.

"I'm Brewconia, this is Droop."

A goblin wearing a finely tailored but well stained suit pokes out from behind her legs.

"Let me get a round for you, and you can get the next 2..."

She entertains and dazzles the whole pub, performing with her goblin sidekick and singing fantastical tales of demons, vampires, and legends from far away.

You drink, sing, and laugh for hours.

Brewconia, however, is long gone before you realize the goblin robbed your coin purse.

Perhaps you should "interrogate" some Hobgoblins to track him down.

---

### Aqua Lungs

The magic bubble that's been following you around reacts your power.

It begins to orbit you rapidly as it transforms into a self contained apparatus

The transformed bubble attaches itself to you.

You may now travel in water.
